It is our duty to see that there is sufficient stock of blood in various blood banks throughout the year.<span class="dots">...</span><span class ="more">
                      
                      Mr. Haribabu said along with the overall development of the city, incidences of accidents and fatal diseases, where there is need of urgent transfusion of blood is also on the rise. And the balance between demand and supply should always be maintained.
                      
                      Appreciating enthusiasm of students, he urged them to come forward and encourage the culture of blood donation and also create awareness among others that there is nothing wrong in donating blood. “It is in fact good to donate once in a while and one should know that a donor can save at least three lives,” he said.
